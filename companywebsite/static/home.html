            In the 9th century the Arab chemist Al-Kindi (Alkindus) wrote the
            Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations, which contained 
            more than a hundred recipes for fragrant oils, salves, aromatic waters, 
            and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs. The book also described 
            107 methods and recipes for perfume-making and perfume-making equipment, 
            such as the alembic.
            <br />
            The Persian chemist Ibn Sina (also known as Avicenna) introduced the process 
            of extracting oils from flowers by means of distillation, the procedure most 
            commonly used today. He first experimented with the rose. Until his discovery, 
            liquid perfumes consisted of mixtures of oil and crushed herbs or petals, which 
            made a strong blend. Rose water was more delicate, and immediately became popular. 
            Both the raw ingredients and the distillation technology significantly influenced 
            western perfumery and scientific developments, particularly chemistry.
